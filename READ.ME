 **automobile price prediction** using various steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling with XGBoost. Here's a breakdown:

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
   - It identifies and replaces missing values (`?`) with `NaN` and corrects incorrectly typed columns.

2. **Missing Value Imputation**:
   - The `KNNImputer` is used to fill missing values in numeric columns.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converts object data types to numeric where applicable.
   - Encodes categorical features like `make`, `engine-type`, and `num-of-cylinders` with numerical labels.
   - Drops irrelevant columns like `num-of-doors`.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Categorical columns are one-hot encoded.
   - Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
   - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is applied for dimensionality reduction.

5. **Modeling**:
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Builds a pipeline that includes scaling, PCA, and the `XGBRegressor` model for regression.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Predicts automobile prices on the test set.
   - Evaluates the model using the RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
   - Compares the predicted and true values using a bar plot.

### Visualization:
   - Heatmaps and bar plots are used to explore correlations and visualize comparisons between predictions and true values.

This pipeline ensures robust predictions of automobile prices by applying preprocessing, PCA, and model training steps.
